	// Use SDL file read and write functions to open a lua file and run it.
	// I think this macro works because loadfile returns 0 if everything is good, so it'll evaluate the pcall because it's looking for something to evaluate to anything but 0. If loadfile isn't all good, it won't return 0 and therefor won't pcall.
	// HOWEVER, THERE IS A PROBLEM. Because I'm using the || thingie, it'll return 1 if either of them is not 1. So, if one returns 7, this macro will still return 1. I'm not the one who designed this, don't look at me. However, it's probably better because you wouldn't be able to tell pcall and loadfile errors apart.
